Gary, Bill

I've installed my data collection scripts on islandora-dev,
islandora-test and islandora-prod.

Pending your approval, I have not changed any of the boot-up
environment on islandora-prod (see end of this email).

Currently the 'jvmtop-monitor' script is running on all three hosts,
logging raw data to /var/log/jvmtop-monitor.log - I'm not yet writing
directly to any RRDBs using rrdtool because I'm not sure I've got it
right yet, so I'd like to keep the raw data.

Here's what I've done on all three hosts:

Needed a ruby gem, installed:

  gem install syslogger

Modified /etc/rsyslog.conf

 originally:

   *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages

 becomes:

   *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none;local1.none    /var/log/messages
   local1.*				                   /var/log/jvmtop-monitor.log

 then:

  service rsyslog restart
  chmod 644 /var/log/jvmtop-monitor.log

Added the file /etc/logrotate.d/jvmtop-monitor

    # Log rotation for fedora-related monitoring log.  Handled via (r)syslog.
    # Rotate weekly, keeping a years worth of (compressed) logs.
    #
    /var/log/jvmtop-monitor.log
    {
	missingok
	notifempty
	weekly
	rotate 51
	dateext
	delaycompress
	compress
	copytruncate
	create 0644 root root
    }

Installed  /usr/local/bin/jvmtop-monitor

Installed startup script  /etc/init.d/jvmtop-monitor

    service jvmtop-monitor start

Note: the jvmtop-monitor startup script's  priority is listed
as 'chkconfig - 93 7'

Pending your approval for the above, I did not do the following on
islandora-prod, though I have done it on islandora-dev and
islandora-test:

Since jvmtop-monitor should run after fedora, I changed
/etc/init.d/fedora's priority to 'chkconfig - 91 9' (was
'chkconfig - 99 1')

    chkconfig fedora resetpriorities
    chkconfig --add jvmtop-monitor
    chkconfig jvmtop-monitor on
